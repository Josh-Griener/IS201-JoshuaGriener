                        <p>
                            &emsp;Like I previously mentioned I am the youngest of 6! I have 3 older brothers and 2 older sisters.

                        </ul>

                        <p class="HobbyHeaders">Sports</p>
                        <img width="600"class="PicLayoutFat"src="../images/swim.JPG" alt="Photo of the state meet for swimming my senior year."><br>
                        <p>
                            I love sports! Ever since I was little I have been super competetive and I love playing and watching sports.
                            In middleschool I swam, played baseball, and played football. However, once I got to highschool I decided to stick with swimming. I loved 
                            every second of my swimming career and it will always be a passion of mine!
                        </p>

                        <p class="HobbyHeaders">Fishing and Backpacking</p>
                        <img width="600"class="PicLayoutTall"src="../images/fish.PNG" alt="Photo of me Fly-fishing."><br>
                        <p>
                            Every chance I get to spend in the mountains I take it! I love fly-fishing and backpacking and I've been doing both from a young age.
                            I first learned to fly fish when I was about 7 and I got hooked immedietly. From my point of view there is nothing in this world quite like spending time alone in nature. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="HobbyHeaders">Music</p>

                        </iframe> <br>
                        <p>
                            Another one of my passions is music. Although there are a ton of generes i enjoy some of my favorites include: indie rock, r&b, rap, and classic rock.
                            A few artists I love are: Led Zepplin, Hozier, The Decemberists, The Head and the Heart, J. Cole, and The Shins. The video above is Hozier performing of my favorite songs of his.

                            I served an LDS mission! I was able to serve both in Sacramento california, as well as Santiago Chile. My mission was incredible and I met so many amazing people.
                            The photo above is me and one of my companions, Elder Rosario. We served together in a small beach town in Chile named Cartagena. It was beautiful!
